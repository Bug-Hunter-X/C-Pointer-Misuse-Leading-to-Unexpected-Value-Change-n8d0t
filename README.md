This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common error related to pointer manipulation. The program initializes an integer variable `x`, then modifies its value indirectly through a pointer. This can lead to unexpected results if not handled correctly. The solution demonstrates how to correctly use pointers and prevent unintended value changes.
